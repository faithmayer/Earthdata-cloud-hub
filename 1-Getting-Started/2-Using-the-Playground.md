# Using the Playground

## How do I get access to the Earthdata Cloud Playground?


Earthdata Login? (this should go in a tutorial - how do I)

## Ground rules for Playground use
This space is meant for small, temporary experiments in order for users to get to know cloud-based features and workflows. Below are some ground rules to ensure prudent and safe use of the Hub:
- …
- Log out when you are finished for your session or not actively using it 
    - Sub-group 1 met with OpenScienceLab from ASF and one of the things they did to encourage users to do this was: 
        - Rename the Logout button to "Shutdown and Logout"
- Choose the smallest server size to start
    - As you progress in your learning, you may find you need to use a larger server size. Please scale appropriately. 

## How do I use what is provided?
- If you are new to working with NASA Earthdata data in the cloud, we recommend starting with the Working with NASA Earthdata Data - How Do I … section which offers building blocks for data search and access 
- To see how those building blocks can be used together to start piecing together a science workflow in the cloud, see the Data Stories folder.

## How do I bring in my own notebooks, scripts or code?
There are a few ways to bring your own existing notebooks, scripts, and codes to the Earthdata Cloud Hub.
- Drag and drop a file from your local computer into the Earthdata Hub’s File Browser
- Clone a repository into the Earthdata Hub

## How do I upload my own data?

## How do I save my code and/or share with others outside of the Cloud JupyterHub?
- Insert Github 101 as a suggested pathway e.g. https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/contributing/workflow.html#github-workflow 

## How do I install a library that’s missing from the default cloud environment?

## How do I create and use a new kernel/environment?
- Using corn? https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/environment-setup/ 

## How do I monitor my cloud cost and compute resources usage in this Hub?
AWS Console? - does this go into offboarding?

## How do I log out and shut down my instance once I am done using it?
