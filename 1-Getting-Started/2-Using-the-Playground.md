# Using the Playground

## __we may not need this__ How do I get access to the Earthdata Cloud Playground?

## Ground rules
This space is meant for small, temporary experiments that help users to get to know cloud-based features and workflows before deciding whether to implement them on their own cloud-hosted resources. Below are some ground rules to ensure prudent and safe use of the Playground:
- Choose the smallest server size to start
    - As you progress in your learning, you may find you need to use a larger server size. Please scale appropriately. 
- Start with a small, testable portion of your larger workflow.
- Log out when you are finished for your session or not actively using it 
    - Sub-group 1 met with OpenScienceLab from ASF and one of the things they did to encourage users to do this was: 
        - Rename the Logout button to "Shutdown and Logout"

## How do I use what is provided?
- We recommend starting to explore the __[Data How-Tos|../Data-How-Tos/]__ folder, which offers building blocks for NASA Earthdata search and access in the cloud. 
- Then, to see how those building blocks can be used to piece together a scientific workflow in the cloud, explore the __[Data Stories|../Data-Stories/]__ folder.
- If after this exploration you find that a cloud workflow would be beneficial to you, you can find out what options can help you "graduate" from the Playground in the __[Offboarding|../Offboarding/]__ folder. 
- And for any background or support information you're looking for, check out the contents of the __[Getting Started|../Getting-Started/]__ folder.

## How do I bring in my own notebooks, scripts or code?
There are a few ways to bring your own existing notebooks, scripts, and codes to the Earthdata Cloud Hub.
- Drag and drop a file from your local computer into the Earthdata Hub’s File Browser
- Clone a repository into the Earthdata Hub

## How do I upload my own data?

## How do I save my code and/or share it with others outside of the Earthdata Cloud Playground?
- Insert Github 101 as a suggested pathway e.g. https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/contributing/workflow.html#github-workflow 

## How do I install a package that’s missing from the default cloud environment?
- You may use conda or pip to install a package that is not currently in the Playground. _However, this installation will not persist between sessions of active use._ You will need to install the package each session. 
- Write a request in the NASA Earthdata Cloud Playground GitHub repository's [Issues|https://github.com/nasa/Earthdata-cloud-playground/issues] tab listing which package you require and what necessitates its use for your workflow. A Playground maintainer will consider your request, and if approved, the package will be integrated into the default list of packages available. 

## How do I create and use a new kernel/environment?
- Using corn? https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/environment-setup/ 

## How do I monitor my cloud cost and compute resources usage in this Hub?
AWS Console? - does this go into offboarding?

## How do I log out and shut down my instance once I am done using it?
