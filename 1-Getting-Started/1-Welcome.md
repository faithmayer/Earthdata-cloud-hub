# Welcome

## What is this space? 
The Earthdata Cloud Playground is a [JupyterHub|https://jupyter.org/hub] built on top of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the same cloud provider that currently hosts NASA Earthdata. This space allows users an opportunity to trial the "in-place analysis" that allows them to access and analyze NASA Earthdata data collections from the cloud without downloading data. 

The Earthdata Cloud Playground aims to provide an easy path for users to both test their workflows running in the cloud and facilitate a transition to their own separately-funded cloud environment. The Playground is built as a cross-DAAC collaboration with contributions to content coming from DAAC representatives of different disciplines. 

- Scope of space, limitations and benefits of using the Sandbox
- Describe different areas of the JupyterHub: file nav bar on left, terminals, jupyter notebooks, shared areas (if exist), etc.
