## What is this space? 
_ADD ABOUT STATEMENT_
The Earthdata Cloud Playground aims to provide an easy path for users to test their workloads running in the cloud and facilitate a transition to their own separately-funded cloud environment. The Hub is built as a cross-DAAC collaboration with contributions to content coming from DAAC representatives of different disciplines.
